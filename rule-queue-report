# This describes the current state of the rule queue. It reports the total
# number of executions in the queue. It also reports the number of executions
# scheduled to run during given hours, the number of executions for each rule,
# and the number of executions scheduled for each user. Finally, it reports the
# number or executions be performed currently and information about them. For
# each execution being performed, it reports the hour the execution was
# scheduled to be performed, the user who triggered the execution, and the
# execution's rule ID, REI ID, and rule. The output is similar to the following.
#
# 202 Rules in Queue
